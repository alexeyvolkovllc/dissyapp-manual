App Store description

Are you running out of free space on your Mac? Try Dissy and find out what is taking up the most space on your computer and get rid of old and unnecessary files that you may have forgotten about.
Dissy will scan a whole disk or a single folder and display the list of all files you have on your Mac.
A convenient interface allows you to see the biggest objects immediately and, if necessary, delete them from your computer.
Dissy will show you the size of files and when they were last modified. This way, you can easily find files that you no longer need, but which are still taking up disk space.
Do you create duplicates of files and folders?  Sometimes you may forget to delete them after you don’t need them anymore or you don’t remember where you placed them. Dissy will help you to find duplicates and free up the disk space they are taking up.
After you scan a directory, you can sort results by type, size, last modification and name.
Also you can view files of a certain type, size and modification time.
As you understand, Dissy provides useful settings with which you can set your own parameters for displaying the analysis results.
